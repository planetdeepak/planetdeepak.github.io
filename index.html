<p> Shohrat is a hindi word meaning fame.  

<p> I was under tremendous pressure (self imposed) while shooting Shohrat. I was not able to complete the shooting of my last film lahu munh lag gaya. It was my project and though I was tremendouly upset about the unfinished film, I was not answerable to anybody. 
<p> With Shohrat the things were different. The project was entirely driven on emotions from the begining. Everyone had attached big hopes from the film. Moreover they had put their complete faith in me. In such scenario the question "What if I could not complete this film?" kept on haunting me till the time I called wrap-up on the last day of the shoot. 

<h3> Trivia </h3>
<ul>
<li> The backstory of the character Fakira was based on the life of the late superstar Vinod Khanna. It was a small tribute to the actor from me.
<li> The man-animal comparison was influnced from a similar anology in the film "The Buddha in a trafic jam". The scene made a big impact on me and I always wanted to use it somewhere. My wish was fulfilled. 
</ul>
